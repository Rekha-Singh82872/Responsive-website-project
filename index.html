        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while informal education entails unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">This editorial is based on “A broken education system: Apps and coaching classes are the wrong solution” which was published in Indian Express on 21/12/2023. The article discusses the education sector being in a state of crisis partly due to reckless commercialisation and politicisation which must be rebuilt with a step-by-step strategy and a national consensus that commits to insulate it from narrow political considerations.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The primary field exploring education is known as education studies, also termed education sciences. It seeks to understand how knowledge is transmitted and acquired by examining various methods and forms of education. This discipline delves into the goals, impacts, and significance of education, along with the cultural, societal, governmental, and historical contexts that influence it.[129] Education theorists draw insights from various disciplines, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, economics, history, politics, and international relations. Consequently, some argue that education studies lacks the clear methodological and subject delineations found in disciplines like physics or history.</p>
